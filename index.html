    <h1>Hi Baby </h1>

    <p>
      Hi my baby, <br><br>
      I want to apologize for my actions yesterday as they were not good and we both know I can du better. I love you so much
      and I have to show that better instead of reacting emotionally. You mean the entire world to me and I am going to work on
      changing my ways for you because you are already perfect for me and I want to be perfect for you. You are so pretty and beyond
      perfect and I am so lucky and grateful to have somoene as sweet and caring as you. Yesterday was not the best day for either of us
      and you still put all your effort into it and I love you for it. Thank you so much for being mine and you will always be special to me. <br><br>
      Love,<br>Du
    </p>
